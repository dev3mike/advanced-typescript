# Advanced Types in TypeScript

This repository is dedicated to exploring and demonstrating the use of advanced types in TypeScript, including **Template Literals**, **Recursive Types**, **Mapped Types**, **Conditional Types**, **Infer**, and **Branded Types**. 

I hope this repository will be helpful for TypeScript developers who want to learn more about the powerful typing features of the language.
